        <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan. Shivaji carved
            out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur which formed the genesis
            of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.
        </p>
        <p>Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the
            Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Shivaji's military forces
            expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji
            established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He
            revived ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi and
            Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian in court and administration.
        </p>
        <p>Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries after his death, he began to take
            on increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence movement, as many Indian nationalists
            elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shivaji was well known for his strong religious and warrior code of ethics and exemplary character. He
            was recognized as a national hero during the Indian Independence Movement. While some accounts of
            Shivaji state that he was greatly influenced by the Brahmin guru Samarth Ramdas, others have said that
            Ramdas' role has been overemphasised by later Brahmin commentators to enhance their position.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shivaji was admired for his heroic expeditions and clever stratagems in the contemporary accounts of
            English, French, Dutch, Portuguese and Italian writers. Contemporary English writers compared him with
            Alexander, Hannibal and Julius Caesar. The French traveller Francois Bernier wrote in his Travels in
            Mughal India:
        </p>
        <p>
            Mughal depictions of Shivaji were largely negative, referring to him simply as "Shiva" without the honorific
            "-ji". One Mughal writer in the early 1700s described Shivaji's death as kafir bi jahannum raft (lit. 'the
            infidel went to Hell'). Mughals never used to respect Marata emperor Shivaji but the mughals were praised as
            lords of modern India by many Political Leaders of Indian National Congress.

        <h2 class="Box-Title">Early Life</h2>
        <div class="Content-Box">
            <p>Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near the city of Junnar, which is now in Pune district.
                Scholars disagree on his date of birth. The Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday
                commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti).
            </p>
            <p>Shivaji was named after a local deity, the goddess Shivai Devi. Shivaji's father Shahaji Bhonsle
                was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates. His mother was Jijabai the daughter of
                Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from the Seuna royal family of
                Devagiri.
            </p>
            <p>Shivaji belonged to a Maratha family of the Bhonsle clan. His paternal grandfather Maloji (1552-1597)
                was an influential general of Ahmadnagar Sultanate, and was awarded the epithet of "Raja". He was given
                deshmukhi rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan and Indapur for military expenses. He was also given Fort
                Shivneri for his family's residence.
            </p>
            <p>At the time of Shivaji's birth, power in the Deccan was shared by three Islamic sultanates: Bijapur,
                Ahmednagar, and Golkonda. Shahaji often changed his loyalty between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the
                Adilshah of Bijapur and the Mughals, but always kept his jagir (fiefdom) at Pune and his small army.</p>
            <p>In 1636, the Adil Shahi sultanate of Bijapur invaded the kingdoms to its south. The sultanate had
                recently become a tributary state of the Mughal empire. It was being helped by Shahaji, who at
                the time was a chieftain in the Maratha uplands of western India. Shahaji was looking for opportunities
                of rewards of jagir land in the conquered territories, the taxes on which he could collect as an
                annuity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shahaji was a rebel from brief Mughal service. Shahaji's campaigns against the Mughals, supported by the
                Bijapur government, were generally unsuccessful. He was constantly pursued by the Mughal army and
                Shivaji and his mother Jijabai had to move from fort to fort.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1636, Shahaji joined in the service of Bijapur and obtained Poona as a grant. Shahaji, being deployed
                in Bangalore by the Bijapuri ruler Adilshah, appointed Dadoji Kondadeo as Poona's administrator. Shivaji
                and Jijabai settled in Poona. Kondadeo died in 1647 and Shivaji took over its administration. One of
                his first acts directly challenged the Bijapuri government.

        <h2 class="Box-Title">Conflict with Bijapur sultanate</h2>
        <div class="Content-Box">
            <p>
                In 1646, 16-year-old Shivaji took the Torna Fort, taking advantage of the confusion prevailing in the
                Bijapur court due to the ailment of Sultan Mohammed Adil Shah, and seized the large treasure he found
                there. In the following two years, Shivaji took several important forts near Pune, including
                Purandar, Kondhana and Chakan. He also brought areas east of Pune around Supa, Baramati, and Indapur
                under his direct control. He used the treasure found at Torna to build a new fort named Rajgad.That fort
                served as the seat of his government for over a decade. After this, Shivaji turned west to the
                Konkan and took possession of the important town of Kalyan. Bijapur government took note of these
                happenings and sought to take action. On 25 July 1648, Shahaji was imprisoned by a fellow Maratha sardar
                called, Baji Ghorpade under the orders of Bijapur government, in a bid to contain Shivaji.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shahaji was released in 1649 after the capture of Jinji secured Adilshah's position in Karnataka. During
                the period of 1649-1655 Shivaji paused in his conquests and quietly consolidated his gains.
                Following his father's release, Shivaji resumed raiding, and in 1656, under controversial circumstances,
                killed Chandrarao More, a fellow Maratha feudatory of Bijapur, and seized the valley of Javali, near the
                present-day hill station of Mahabaleshwar, from him. The conquest of Javali allowed Shivaji to
                extend his raids into South and South-west Maharashtra. In addition to the Bhonsle and the More
                families, many others including Sawant of Sawantwadi, Ghorpade of Mudhol, Nimbalkar of Phaltan, Shirke,
                Mane and Mohite also served Adilshahi of Bijapur, many with Deshmukhi rights. Shivaji adopted different
                strategies to subdue these powerful families such as forming marital alliances, dealing directly with
                village Patils to bypass the Deshmukhs, or subduing them by force. Shahaji in his later years had an
                ambivalent attitude to his son, and disavowed his rebellious activities. He told the Bijapuris to do
                whatever they wanted with Shivaji. Shahaji died around 1664-1665 in a hunting accident.

    <div class="Afzal-Khan Story-Section" id="Combat-Afzal-Khan">
        <h2 class="Box-Title">Combat with Afzal Khan</h2>
        <div class="Content-Box">
            <p>
                The Bijapur sultanate was displeased at their losses to Shivaji's forces, which their vassal Shahaji
                disavowed. After a peace treaty with the Mughals, and the general acceptance of the young Ali Adil Shah
                II as the sultan, the Bijapur government became more stable, and turned its attention towards
                Shivaji. In 1657 the sultan, or more likely his mother and regent, sent Afzal Khan, a veteran
                general, to arrest Shivaji. Before engaging him, the Bijapuri forces desecrated the Tulja Bhavani
                Temple, holy to Shivaji's family, and the Vithoba temple at Pandharpur, a major pilgrimage site for the
                Hindus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pursued by Bijapuri forces, Shivaji retreated to Pratapgad fort, where many of his colleagues pressed
                him to surrender. The two forces found themselves at a stalemate, with Shivaji unable to break the
                siege, while Afzal Khan, having a powerful cavalry but lacking siege equipment, was unable to take the
                fort. After two months, Afzal Khan sent an envoy to Shivaji suggesting the two leaders meet in private,
                outside the fort, for negotiations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two met in a hut at the foothills of Pratapgad fort on 10 November 1659. The arrangements had
                dictated that each come armed only with a sword, and attended by one follower. Shivaji, suspecting Afzal
                Khan would arrest or attack him, wore armour beneath his clothes, concealed a bagh nakh (metal
                "tiger claw") on his left arm, and had a dagger in his right hand. The precise transpirings are not
                recoverable to historical certainty and remains enmeshed with legends in Maratha sources; however, they
                agree upon the fact that the protagonists landed themselves in a physical struggle which would prove
                fatal for Khan. Khan's dagger failed to pierce Shivaji's armour, but Shivaji had him disemboweled; he
                then fired a cannon to signal his hidden troops to attack the Bijapuri army.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the ensuing Battle of Pratapgarh fought on 10 November 1659, Shivaji's forces decisively defeated the
                Bijapur Sultanate's forces. More than 3,000 soldiers of the Bijapur army were killed and one sardar of
                high rank, two sons of Afzal Khan and two Maratha chiefs were taken prisoner. After the victory, a
                grand review was held by Shivaji below Pratapgarh. The captured enemy, both officers and men, were set
                free and sent back to their homes with money, food and other gifts. Marathas were rewarded accordingly.

        <h2 class="Box-Title">Siege of Panhala</h2>
        <div class="Content-Box">
            <p>
                Having defeated the Bijapuri forces sent against him, Shivaji's army marched towards the Konkan and
                Kolhapur, seizing Panhala fort, and defeating Bijapuri forces sent against them under Rustam Zaman and
                Fazl Khan in 1659. In 1660, Adilshah sent his general Siddi Jauhar to attack Shivaji's southern
                border, in alliance with the Mughals who planned to attack from the north. At that time, Shivaji was
                encamped at Panhala fort with his forces. Siddi Jauhar's army besieged Panhala in mid-1660, cutting off
                supply routes to the fort. During the bombardment of Panhala, Siddi Jauhar purchased grenades from the
                English at Rajapur to increase his efficacy, and also hired some English artillerymen to assist in his
                bombardment of the fort, conspicuously flying a flag used by the English. This perceived betrayal
                angered Shivaji, who in December would retaliate by plundering the English factory at Rajapur and
                capturing four of the factors, imprisoning them until mid-1663.
            </p>
            <p>
                After months of siege, Shivaji negotiated with Siddi Jauhar and handed over the fort on 22 September
                1660, withdrawing to Vishalgad; Shivaji retook Panhala in 1673.

    <div class="Battle-Pavan-Khind Story-Section" id="Battle-Pavan-Khind">
        <h2 class="Box-Title">Battle of Pavan Khind</h2>
        <div class="Content-Box">
            <p>
                The Battle of Pavankhind was a rearguard last stand that took place on 13 July 1660, at a mountain
                pass in the vicinity of fort Vishalgad, near the city of Kolhapur by the Maratha warriors Baji Prabhu
                Deshpande and Sambhu Singh Jadhav against Siddi Masud of the Bijapur Sultanate. The engagement
                ended with the destruction of the Maratha forces, and a tactical victory for the Bijapur Sultanate that
                failed to achieve a strategic victory.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1660, Shivaji was trapped in the fort of Panhala, under siege and vastly outnumbered by an Adilshah
                army led by an Abyssinian General called Siddi Masud. Shivaji planned to escape to the Maratha fort of
                Vishalgad. Two Maratha sardars under the Adilshahi General Siddi Jouhar, namely Suryarao Surve and
                Jaswantrao Dalvi had also encircled the fort of Vishalgad simultaneously. Shivaji waited for months,
                planning and depleting the Adilshah's food source.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shivaji, Baji Prabhu, and around 600 of their best troops, would dash through the Adilshahi force at
                night. A man named Shiva Kashid, who resembled Shivaji in appearance, had volunteered to dress like the
                king and get captured. This bought some additional time due to the confusion over identity, before Siddi
                Masud realised the error and gave chase.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shivaji made his escape on the dark night of 13 July, with his troops and the Adilshah army was in
                pursuit with an army of 10,000. It was clear that there was no way to shake off the enemy, and that the
                Marathas would not simultaneously prevail over both the Moghul garrison at Vishalgad and the chasing
                Adilshahi army.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only option was for a section of the Marathas to stay back and fight the larger Adilshahi forces in
                a rearguard action, while the rest of the Marathas would carry on to their destination. Shivaji decided
                to split his forces. Baji Prabhu agreed to face the troops of Bijapur with 300 soldiers. Shivaji told
                Baji Prabhu that he would hear cannons being fired 5 times from Vishalgad, signaling Shivaji’s safety.
                The strategic position of Ghod Khind (Horse Pass) was chosen for the defence, as it was very narrow and
                only a few soldiers could pass at any one time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shivaji escaped from Panhala by cover of night, and as he was pursued by the enemy cavalry, his Maratha
                sardar Baji Prabhu Deshpande of Bandal Deshmukh, along with 300 soldiers, volunteered to fight to the
                death to hold back the enemy at Ghod Khind ("horse ravine") to give Shivaji and the rest of the army a
                chance to reach the safety of the Vishalgad fort.
            </p>
            <p>
                Baji Prabhu occupied Ghod Khind, blocking the path of the Adilshah troops. His brother Fulaji Prabhu as
                well as sardars such as Shambusing Jadhav were present with him. Fulaji Prabhu and Shambusing were
                killed after a gallant and fierce fight. Baji Prabhu was severely wounded but carried on fighting at his
                station. The Adilshahi army repeatedly tried to break through the defenses of the pass, but were
                repeatedly repulsed. The unequal battle raged for hours, with the defenders maintaining their positions,
                but with rapidly depleting numbers. Only a handful of Marathas survived, and around a thousand soldiers
                of the Adilshahi army became casualties in attempting to take the pass.
            </p>
            <p>
                Five hours after the battle started, the cannon fire announcing Shivaji’s safe return to Vishalgad was
                heard. Almost three hundred Marathas had been killed. Legend has it that a gravely injured Baji Prabhu
                continued engaging the enemy and held the pass, only laying down his life once he heard the sound of
                cannon fire. The handful surviving Marathas then retreated and disappeared in the forest as per the
                plan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shivaji and his 300 soldiers had to break through the encirclement of Suryarao and Jaswantrao at
                Vishalgadh. A fierce battle ensued in which Shivaji himself fought wearing Dandpatta in his both hands.
                Seeing this fight, the commander of Vishalgadh fort sent help to Shivaji enabling him and his troops to
                reach the fort safely. Shivaji then fired cannons as a signal for Baji Prabhu to retreat.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the ensuing Battle of Pavan Khind, the smaller Maratha force held back the larger enemy to buy time
                for Shivaji to escape. Baji Prabhu Deshpande was wounded but continued to fight until he heard the sound
                of cannon fire from Vishalgad, signalling Shivaji had safely reached the fort, on the evening of 13
                July 1660. Ghod Khind (khind meaning "a narrow mountain pass") was later renamed Paavan Khind
                ("sacred pass") in honour of Bajiprabhu Deshpande, Shibosingh Jadhav, Fuloji, and all other soldiers who
                fought in there.

                Until 1657, Shivaji maintained peaceful relations with the Mughal Empire. Shivaji offered his assistance
                to Aurangzeb, the son of the Mughal Emperor and viceroy of the Deccan, in conquering Bijapur in return
                for formal recognition of his right to the Bijapuri forts and villages under his possession.
                Dissatisfied with the Mughal response, and receiving a better offer from Bijapur, he launched a raid
                into the Mughal Deccan. Shivaji's confrontations with the Mughals began in March 1657, when two of
                Shivaji's officers raided the Mughal territory near Ahmednagar. This was followed by raids in
                Junnar, with Shivaji carrying off 300,000 hun in cash and 200 horses. Aurangzeb responded to the
                raids by sending Nasiri Khan, who defeated the forces of Shivaji at Ahmednagar. However, Aurangzeb's
                countermeasures against Shivaji were interrupted by the rainy season and his battle of succession with
                his brothers for the Mughal throne following the illness of the emperor Shah Jahan.

        <div class="Content-Box">
            <p>
                The Battle of Chakan was fought between the Marathas and the Mughal Empire in the year 1660. The
                Mughal army advancing towards Pune had to overcome the fort of Chakan around 30 km from the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fort of Chakan was a Bhuikot, i.e. a land fort and was occupied by around 800 infantry. Mughal
                forces laid siege to the fort hoping for a quick surrender by the numerically inferior Maratha garrison.
                However the Mughal artillery was unable to force the fort into submission. Several assaults by the
                Mughals were repulsed with high casualties.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Mughals pounded on the minor fortress with their heavy artillery but the defenders were brave enough
                to still defend the fort. The Mughals had to mine the fort and a lot of defenders had died in the attack
                but to the surprise of the Mughals, the Marathas had built a mini-mountain of dirt and earth and were
                striking 'rockets, musket-shots, bombs and stones'.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Mughal commander Shaista Khan was surprised with the prolonged resistance offered at the relatively
                small fort. The siege revealed glaring shortcomings of Mughal army like poor strategy and tactics and
                overconfidence. These were exploited by the Marathas when they routed a Mughal force deployed in Konkan,
                and again during the most celebrated strike at Shaista Khan's camp in Pune. After this battle, Aurangzeb
                continued to keep Shaista Khan as commander-in-force of the Mughal Army in the Deccan however he soon
                dismissed him to the province of Bengal after his camp in the Lal Mahal was attacked by Shivaji.

        <div class="Content-Box">
            <p>
                Battle of Surat, also known as the Sack of Surat, was a land battle that took place on January 5,
                1664, near the city of Surat, in present-day Gujarat, India; between Maratha ruler Shivaji and Inayat
                Khan, a Mughal commander. The Marathas defeated the Mughal force, and ransacked the city of Surat for
                six days.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to James Grant Duff, a captain in the British India Regiment, Surat was attacked by Shivaji on
                5 January 1664. Surat was a wealthy port city in the Mughal Empire and was useful for the Mughals as it
                was used for the sea trade of the Arabian Sea. The city was well populated mostly by Hindus and Muslims,
                especially the officials in the Mughal administration of the city. The attack was so sudden that the
                population had no chance to flee. The plunder was continued for six days and two-thirds of the city was
                burnt down. The loot was then transferred to Rajgad fort.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Shaista Khan, the Mughal governor, was in Deccan for more than three years fighting the Marathas, the
                financial condition of the Maratha Kingdom was dire. So to improve his finances, Shivaji planned to
                attack Surat, a key Mughal power centre, and a wealthy port town that generated a million rupees in
                taxes. His aim was to capture and loot the wealthy port city and bring all the loot to his main
                residence, the Raigad Fort.
            </p>
            <p>
                Local Subedar, Inayat Khan who was appointed by Aurangzeb. After sacking the Mughal garrison, Shivaji
                attacked the Port of Surat and set the local shipping industry ablaze.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shivaji was assisted by commanders along with a cavalry of 10000.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shivaji attacked Surat after demand for the tribute was rejected. The Mughal Chieftains was very
                surprised by the suddenness of the attack, unwilling to face the Maratha forces, he hid himself in the
                Fort of Surat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Surat was under attack for nearly three days, in which the Maratha army looted all possible wealth from
                traders of the Mughul Guzerat subah and others such as the Portuguese trading centers. The Maratha
                soldiers took away cash, gold, silver, pearls, rubies, diamonds& emeralds from the houses of rich
                merchants such as Virji Vora, Haji Zahid Beg, Haji Kasim and others. The business of Mohandas Parekh,
                the deceased broker of the Dutch East India Company, was spared as he was reputed as a charitable
                man. Similarly, Chhatrapati Shivaji did not plunder the houses of the foreign missionaries. The
                French traveller Francois Bernier wrote this in his Travels in Mughal India.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shivaji had to complete the sacking of Surat before the Mughal empire at Delhi was alerted, and he could
                not afford to spend much time attacking the English East India Company. Thus, Sir George Oxenden was
                able to successfully defend the Surat factory, a fortified warehouse-counting house-hostel.
            </p>
            <p>
                All this loot was transported to the Deccan before the Mughal Empire at Delhi was informed of the
                sacking of Surat. This wealth later was used for developing and strengthening the Maratha state.
                This event enraged the Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb. The revenue of the Mughal Empire was reduced as trade
                did not flourish as much after Shivaji's raid on the Port of Surat.

        <div class="Content-Box">
            <p>
                The Battle of Sinhagad, also known as Battle of Kondhana, involved an attack by the forces of the
                Maratha Empire during the night of 4 February 1670 on the fort of Sinhagad (then Kondhana), near the
                city of Pune, Maharashtra, in the Mughal Empire (present-day India). The Marathas captured the fort.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 1650s, Aurangzeb sent Shahiste Khan to subdue Shivaji. Khan captured Poona (Now Pune) and took
                residence in Lal Mahal. Shivaji and his soldiers made a surprise attack on the Khan, wherein they
                wounded Khan, and killed one of his sons. However, Khan eventually escaped. Shivaji went on to loot and
                plunder the wealthy port city of Surat, which at that time was a centre of great riches and wealthy
                merchants. This greatly increased Aurangzeb's anger against the Marathas. He sent his General Mirza
                Rajah Jai Singh with a large army to subdue Shivaji. Jai Singh besieged Purandar fort. Meanwhile, Diler
                Khan defeated the armies at Vajragad, near Purandar. The Mughals plundered villages in the Maratha
                kingdom. For the welfare of his subjects, Shivaji decided to sign a treaty with Jai Singh. They met and
                signed the Treaty of Purandar. According to the treaty, Shivaji was to give 23 forts to the Mughals and
                agree to fight for them when needed. He would be allowed to retain control of 12 forts. Later, he agreed
                to meet Aurangzeb at Agra.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon reaching Agra, Aurangzeb put him under house arrest, but Sivaji managed to escape. Shivaji then
                kept a low profile for some years until Aurangzeb increased activities in the north. Later, Jai Singh
                died at Burhanpur, and a weaker prince, Muazzam, became governor of Deccan. Shivaji then felt that this
                was a good opportunity to reclaim what had belonged to the Swarajya. He broke the treaty and started
                recapturing the forts that he had previously given the Mughals under the treaty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sinhagad was one of the first forts which chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj recaptured from the Mughals. The
                capture was made possible by scaling the walls at night with rope ladders. In this battle both Udaybhan
                Rathore and Tanhaji were killed, but the fort was captured by the Marathas. The battle and Tanhaji's
                exploits are a popular subject for Marathi ballads.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tanaji Malusare and 300 hand-picked Mavle infantry, assisted by some Koli guides, scaled the hillside
                using rope ladders. They advanced into the fort, killing the sentinels. The alarm was sounded and the
                Mughals took some time to arm themselves and come out, allowing the Marathas to secure their footing.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the attack, Malusare scaled a steep cliff that led to the fort with the assistance of a monitor
                lizard called Yashwanti (also referred to as ghorpad in Marathi language).[additional citation(s)
                needed][unreliable source?] This type of lizard had been tamed[clarification needed]since the 15th
                century, and Yashwanti was trained to pull the rope up the cliffs for Malusare and wind it around the
                fort's bastion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Climbing up the fort, the Marathas were intercepted by the garrison and combat ensued between the guards
                and several infiltrators that had managed to climb up. Tanaji and his Mavala infantrymen climbed the
                Kalyan darwaza (transl. Gate), one of the two main gates of the fort. The garrison fought desperately,
                but the Maratha Mavales wreaked havoc in their ranks. Tanaji and Udaybhan fought each other
                intensely, killing each other after a one on one combat. Tanaji's shield broke during the battle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Maratha soldiers then set fire to the cavalry's huts, and the blaze informed Shivaji at Raigad that
                Kondhana has been captured.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Maharaj Shivaji got the information about the victory and the loss of Tanaji's life during the
                battle, he exclaimed "Gad aala pan sinh gela" (Devnagari: गड आला पण सिंह गेला) (transl. "The fort has
                been captured but we lost the lion"). A bust of Tanaji Malusare was installed at the fort in memory of
                his contribution and sacrifice. The fort was also renamed Sinhagad to honor his memory.

            <p>
                The Battle of Purandar was fought between the Mughal Empire and Maratha Empire in 1665. The Mughal
                Emperor, Aurangzeb, appointed Jai Singh to lead a 14,000 strong army against Shivaji and deputed several
                Mughal commanders like Dilir Khan, Rai Singh, Sujan Singh and Daud Khan to serve Jai Singh in his
                campaign. to besiege Shivaji's fortress at Purandar. After Mughal forces killed Maratha General,
                Murarbaji on 2 June 1665, Shivaji surrendered and gave up 23 of his fortresses But soon he regained all
                his strength and all the fortresses that he lost in the Battle Of Purandar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shivaji Maharaj attacked six Mughal generals at Lal Mahal of Poona (Now Pune). Then Shivaji Maharaj
                sacked Surat, a prosperous port city back then which inhabited lots of rich merchants from all parts of
                India, China, Turkey, England and the Netherlands. Shivaji Maharaj got huge amount of wealth in this
                loot. Later, in 1665 Aurangzeb sent his general Mirza Raja Jai Singh to subdue Shivaji Maharaj and the
                Adil Shahi dynasty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jai Singh besieged Purandar fort in 1665. He won the neighbouring Vajragad fort in the middle of April.
                He surrounded Purandar and attacked the walls of the fort with cannons. Marathas fought bravely. The
                commandant Murarbaji fought courageously. He with his selected 700 fighters made a sortie on Diler Khan,
                who was only second in command after Mirza Rajah Jai Singh. Diler Khan with his 5000 Afghans and some
                more troop of other races was trying to climb the hill. Marathas marched forward and attacked these
                Mughal enemy from all sides and fought severe fighting at close quarters. Murar Baji and his Maratha men
                slew 500 Pathan and Bahlia infantrymen. Murar Baji rushed towards Diler Khan. The later offered him high
                post under him and promised his life. Murar indignantly refused and was going to strike Diler Khan when
                the latter shot him down with an arrow. The garrison continued the struggle. But due to the firing of
                cannons 5 towers and one stockade won by enemies. The garrison was heavily outnumbered against the
                numerically superior Mughals. They suffered huge casualties in the fight that lasted two months. Shivaji
                found it futile to prolong and resist. The families of Maratha officers were sheltered inside the fort,
                so its capture would cause captivity. Due to this, Shivaji decided to meet Jai Singh and offer terms of
                peace. If these were rejected, he would make alliance with Adil Shah by restoring Konkan and continuing
                war against the Mughals with renewed vigour.

                After winning the Battle of Purandar, Mughals go to take Sanganer Fort, but Marathas did not give
                Sanganer Fort, then Diler Himmat Khan attacked Sanganer Fort and captured the fort, and 30,000 were

        <div class="Content-Box">
            <p>
                In 1666, Aurangzeb summoned Shivaji to Agra (though some sources instead state Delhi), along with his
                nine-year-old son Sambhaji. Aurangzeb's planned to send Shivaji to Kandahar, now in Afghanistan, to
                consolidate the Mughal empire's northwestern frontier. However, in the court, on 12 May 1666, Shivaji
                was made to stand alongside relatively low-ranking nobles, men he had already defeated in battle.
                Shivaji took offence and stormed out of court, and was promptly placed under house arrest. Ram
                Singh, son of Jai Singh, guaranteed custody of Shivaji and his son.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shivaji's position under house arrest was perilous, as Aurangzeb's court debated whether to kill him or
                continue to employ him. Jai Singh, having assured Shivaji of his personal safety, tried to influence
                Aurangzeb's decision. Meanwhile, Shivaji hatched a plan to free himself. He sent most of his men
                back home and asked Ram Singh to withdraw his guarantees to the emperor for the safe custody of himself
                and his son and surrendered himself to Mughal forces. Shivaji then pretended to be ill and began
                sending out large baskets packed with sweets to be given to the Brahmins and poor as
                penance. On 17 August 1666, by putting himself in one of the large baskets and his son
                Sambhaji in another, Shivaji escaped and left Agra.
            </p>
            <p>
                After Shivaji's escape, hostilities with the Mughals ebbed, with Mughal sardar Jaswant Singh acting as
                an intermediary between Shivaji and Aurangzeb for new peace proposals. During the period between
                1666 and 1668, Aurangzeb conferred the title of raja on Shivaji. Sambhaji was also restored as a Mughal
                mansabdar with 5,000 horses. Shivaji at that time sent Sambhaji with general Prataprao Gujar to serve
                with the Mughal viceroy in Aurangabad, Prince Mu'azzam. Sambhaji was also granted territory in Berar for
                revenue collection. Aurangzeb also permitted Shivaji to attack the decaying Adil Shahi; the weakened
                Sultan Ali Adil Shah II sued for peace and granted the rights of sardeshmukhi and chauthai to Shivaji.

                The peace between Shivaji and the Mughals lasted until 1670. At that time Aurangzeb became suspicious of
                the close ties between Shivaji and Mu'azzam, who he thought might usurp his throne, and may even have
                been receiving bribes from Shivaji. Also at that time, Aurangzeb, occupied in fighting the
                Afghans, greatly reduced his army in the Deccan; many of the disbanded soldiers quickly joined Maratha
                service. The Mughals also took away the jagir of Berar from Shivaji to recover the money lent to him
                a few years earlier. In response, Shivaji launched an offensive against the Mughals and recovered a
                major portion of the territories surrendered to them in a span of four months.

            <p>
                Shivaji sacked Surat for a second time in 1670; the English and Dutch factories were able to repel his
                attack, but he managed to sack the city itself, including plundering the goods of a Muslim prince from
                Mawara-un-Nahr who was returning from Mecca. Angered by the renewed attacks, the Mughals resumed
                hostilities with the Marathas, sending a force under Daud Khan to intercept Shivaji on his return home
                from Surat, but were defeated in the Battle of Vani-Dindori near present-day Nashik.
            </p>
            <p>
                In October 1670, Shivaji sent his forces to harass the English at Bombay; as they had refused to sell
                him war materiel, his forces blocked English woodcutting parties from leaving Bombay. In September 1671,
                Shivaji sent an ambassador to Bombay, again seeking materiel, this time for the fight against
                Danda-Rajpuri. The English had misgivings of the advantages Shivaji would gain from this conquest, but
                also did not want to lose any chance of receiving compensation for his looting their factories at
                Rajapur. The English sent Lieutenant Stephen Ustick to treat with Shivaji, but negotiations failed over
                the issue of the Rajapur indemnity. Numerous exchanges of envoys followed over the coming years, with
                some agreement as to the arms issues in 1674, but Shivaji was never to pay the Rajapur indemnity before
                his death, and the factory there dissolved at the end of 1682.

                In 1674, Prataprao Gujar, the commander-in-chief of the Maratha forces, was sent to push back the
                invading force led by the Bijapuri general, Bahlol Khan. Prataprao's forces defeated and captured the
                opposing general in the battle, after cutting-off their water supply by encircling a strategic lake,
                which prompted Bahlol Khan to sue for peace. In spite of Shivaji's specific warnings against doing so,
                Prataprao released Bahlol Khan, who started preparing for a fresh invasion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shivaji sent a displeased letter to Prataprao, refusing him audience until Bahlol Khan was re-captured.
                Upset by his commander's rebuke, Prataprao found Bahlol Khan and charged his position with only six
                other horsemen, leaving his main force behind. Prataprao was killed in combat; Shivaji was deeply
                grieved on hearing of Prataprao's death, and arranged for the marriage of his second son, Rajaram, to
                Prataprao's daughter. Prataprao was succeeded by Hambirrao Mohite, as the new sarnaubat
                (commander-in-chief of the Maratha forces). Raigad Fort was newly built by Hiroji Indulkar as a capital
                of the nascent Maratha kingdom.

                Shivaji had acquired extensive lands and wealth through his campaigns, but lacking a formal title, he
                was still technically a Mughal zamindar or the son of a Bijapuri jagirdar, with no legal basis to rule
                his de facto domain. A kingly title could address this and also prevent any challenges by other Maratha
                leaders, to whom he was technically equal. it would also provide the Hindu Marathas with a fellow
                Hindu sovereign in a region otherwise ruled by Muslims.
            </p>
            <p>
                The preparation for the proposed coronation began in 1673. However, some controversial problems delayed
                the coronation by almost a year. Controversy erupted amongst the Brahmins of Shivaji's court: they
                refused to crown Shivaji as a king because that status was reserved for those of the kshatriya (warrior)
                varna in Hindu society. Shivaji was descended from a line of headmen of farming villages, and the
                Brahmins accordingly categorised him as being of the shudra (cultivator) varna. They noted
                that Shivaji had never had a sacred thread ceremony, and did not wear the thread, which a kshatriya
                would. Shivaji summoned Gaga Bhatt, a pandit of Varanasi, who stated that he had found a genealogy
                proving that Shivaji was descended from the Sisodias, and thus indeed a kshatriya, albeit one in need of
                the ceremonies befitting his rank. To enforce this status, Shivaji was given a sacred thread
                ceremony, and remarried his spouses under the Vedic rites expected of a kshatriya. However,
                following historical evidence, Shivaji's claim to Rajput, and specifically Sisodia ancestry may be
                interpreted as being anything from tenuous at best, to inventive in a more extreme reading.
            </p>
            <p>
                On 28 May, Shivaji performed penance for not observing Kshatriya rites by his ancestors' and himself for
                so long. Then he was invested by Gaga Bhatt with the sacred thread. On insistence of other
                Brahmins, Gaga Bhatt dropped the Vedic chant and initiated Shivaji in a modified form of the life of the
                twice-born, instead of putting him on a par with the Brahmins. Next day, Shivaji made atonement for the
                sins, deliberate or accidental, committed in his own lifetime. He was weighed separately against
                seven metals including gold, silver and several other articles like fine linen, camphor, salt, sugar
                etc. All these metals and articles along with a lakh of hun were distributed among the Brahmins. But
                even this failed to satisfy the greed of the Brahmins. Two of the learned Brahmins pointed out that
                Shivaji, while conducting his raids, had burnt cities involving the death of Brahmins, cows, women and
                children and he could be cleansed of this sin for a price of Rs. 8,000, and Shivaji paid this
                amount. Total expenditure made for feeding the assemblage, general alms giving, throne and
                ornaments approached 1.5 million Rupees.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shivaji was crowned king of the Maratha Empire (Hindawi Swaraj) in a lavish ceremony on 6 June 1674 at
                Raigad fort. In the Hindu calendar it was on the 13th day (trayodashi) of the first fortnight
                of the month of Jyeshtha in the year 1596. Gaga Bhatt officiated, pouring water from a gold vessel
                filled with the waters of the seven sacred rivers Yamuna, Indus, Ganges, Godavari, Narmada, Krishna and
                Kaveri over Shivaji's head, and chanted the Vedic coronation mantras. After the ablution, Shivaji bowed
                before Jijabai and touched her feet. Nearly fifty thousand people gathered at Raigad for the
                ceremonies. Shivaji was entitled Shakakarta ("founder of an era") and Chhatrapati
                ("sovereign"). He also took the title of Haindava Dharmodhhaarak (protector of the Hindu faith) and
                Kshatriya Kulavantas. Kshatriya is one of the four varnas of Hinduism and kulavantas
                means the 'head of the kula, or race'.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shivaji's mother Jijabai died on 18 June 1674. The Marathas summoned Nischal Puri Goswami, a tantrik
                priest, who declared that the original coronation had been held under inauspicious stars, and a second
                coronation was needed. This second coronation on 24 September 1674 had a dual-use, mollifying those who
                still believed that Shivaji was not qualified for the Vedic rites of his first coronation, by performing
                a less-contestable additional ceremony.

                Beginning in 1674, the Marathas undertook an aggressive campaign, raiding Khandesh (October), capturing
                Bijapuri Ponda (April 1675), Karwar (mid-year), and Kolhapur (July). In November, the Maratha navy
                skirmished with the Siddis of Janjira, but failed to dislodge them. Having recovered from an
                illness, and taking advantage of a civil war that had broken out between the Deccanis and the Afghans at
                Bijapur, Shivaji raided Athani in April 1676.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the run-up to his expedition, Shivaji appealed to a sense of Deccani patriotism, that Southern India
                was a homeland that should be protected from outsiders. His appeal was somewhat successful,
                and in 1677 Shivaji visited Hyderabad for a month and entered into a treaty with the Qutubshah of the
                Golkonda sultanate, agreeing to reject his alliance with Bijapur and jointly oppose the Mughals. In
                1677, Shivaji invaded Karnataka with 30,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry, backed by Golkonda artillery
                and funding. Proceeding south, Shivaji seized the forts of Vellore and Gingee; the latter
                would later serve as a capital of the Marathas during the reign of his son Rajaram I.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shivaji intended to reconcile with his half-brother Venkoji (Ekoji I), Shahaji's son by his second wife,
                Tukabai (née Mohite), who ruled Thanjavur (Tanjore) after Shahaji. The initially promising negotiations
                were unsuccessful, so whilst returning to Raigad, Shivaji defeated his half-brother's army on 26
                November 1677 and seized most of his possessions in the Mysore plateau. Venkoji's wife Dipa Bai, whom
                Shivaji deeply respected, took up new negotiations with Shivaji and also convinced her husband to
                distance himself from Muslim advisors. In the end, Shivaji consented to turn over to her and her female
                descendants many of the properties he had seized, with Venkoji consenting to a number of conditions for
                the proper administration of the territories and maintenance of Shahji's memorial (samadhi).

                The question of Shivaji's heir-apparent was complicated. Shivaji confined his son to Panhala in 1678,
                only to have the prince escape with his wife and defect to the Mughals for a year. Sambhaji then
                returned home, unrepentant, and was again confined to Panhala.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shivaji died around 3–5 April 1680 at the age of 50, on the eve of Hanuman Jayanti. The cause of
                Shivaji's death is disputed. British records states that Shivaji died of bloody flux being sick for 12
                days. In a contemporary work in Portuguese, the Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa, the recorded cause of
                death of Shivaji is anthrax. However, Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad, author of Sabhasad Bakhar, the
                biography of Shivaji has mentioned fever as the cause of death of Shivaji. Putalabai, the
                childless eldest of the surviving wives of Shivaji committed sati by jumping into his funeral pyre.
                Another surviving spouse, Sakwarbai, was not allowed to follow suit because she had a young
                daughter. There were also allegations, though doubted by later scholars, that his second wife
                Soyarabai had poisoned him in order to put her 10-year-old son Rajaram on the throne.
            </p>
            <p>
                After Shivaji's death, Soyarabai made plans with various ministers of the administration to crown her
                son Rajaram rather than her stepson Sambhaji. On 21 April 1680, ten-year-old Rajaram was installed on
                the throne. However, the fully grown cub of the great king Shivaji, the new lion of Marata, The Sambhaji
                Maharaj took possession of Raigad Fort after killing the commander, and on 18 June acquired control of
                Raigad, and formally ascended the throne on 20 July. Rajaram, his mother Soyarabai and wife Janki
                Bai were imprisoned, and Soyrabai executed on charges of conspiracy that October.

                Shivaji left behind a state always at odds with the Mughals. Soon after his death, in 1681, Aurangzeb
                launched an offensive in the South to capture territories held by the Marathas, the Bijapur-based
                Adilshahi and Qutb Shahi of Golkonda respectively. He was successful in obliterating the Sultanates but
                could not subdue the Marathas after spending 27 years in the Deccan. The period saw the capture,
                torture, and execution of Sambhaji in 1689, and the Marathas offering strong resistance under the
                leadership of Sambhaji's successor, Rajaram and then Rajaram's widow Tarabai. Territories changed hands
                repeatedly between the Mughals and the Marathas; the conflict ended in defeat for the Mughals in 1707.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shahu, a grandson of Shivaji and son of Sambhaji, was kept prisoner by Aurangzeb during the 27-year
                period conflict. After the latter's death, his successor released Shahu. After a brief power struggle
                over succession with his aunt Tarabai, Shahu ruled the Maratha Empire from 1707 to 1749. Early in his
                reign, he appointed Balaji Vishwanath and later his descendants, as Peshwas (prime ministers) of the
                Maratha Empire. The empire expanded greatly under the leadership of Balaji's son, Peshwa Bajirao I and
                grandson, Peshwa Balaji Bajirao. At its peak, the Maratha empire stretched from Tamil Nadu[175] in the
                south, to Peshawar (modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) in the north, and Bengal, in the east. In 1761, the
                Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat to Ahmed Shah Abdali of the Afghan Durrani Empire, which
                halted their imperial expansion in northwestern India. Ten years after Panipat, Marathas regained
                influence in North India during the rule of Madhavrao Peshwa.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a bid to effectively manage the large empire, Shahu and the Peshwas gave semi-autonomy to the
                strongest of the knights, creating the Maratha Confederacy.[177] They became known as Gaekwads of
                Baroda, the Holkars of Indore and Malwa, the Scindias of Gwalior and Bhonsales of Nagpur. In 1775, the
                East India Company intervened in a succession struggle in Pune, which resulted in the First
                Anglo-Maratha War. The Marathas remained the pre-eminent power in India until their defeat by the
                British in the Second and Third Anglo-Maratha wars (1805–1818), which left the company the dominant
                power in most of India.
