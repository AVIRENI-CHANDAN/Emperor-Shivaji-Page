        <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan. Shivaji carved
            out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur which formed the genesis
            of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.</p>
        <p>Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the
            Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Shivaji's military forces
            expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji
            established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He
            revived ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi and
            Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian in court and administration.</p>
        <p>Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries after his death, he began to take
            on increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence movement, as many Indian nationalists
            elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.</p>

        <h2 class="Box-Title">Early Life</h2>
        <div class="Content-Box">
            <p>Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near the city of Junnar, which is now in Pune district.
                Scholars disagree on his date of birth. The Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday
                commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti).</p>
            <p>Shivaji was named after a local deity, the goddess Shivai Devi. Shivaji's father Shahaji Bhonsle
                was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates.[21] His mother was Jijabai the daughter of
                Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from the Seuna royal family of
                Devagiri.</p>
            <p>Shivaji belonged to a Maratha family of the Bhonsle clan. His paternal grandfather Maloji (1552-1597)
                was an influential general of Ahmadnagar Sultanate, and was awarded the epithet of "Raja". He was given
                deshmukhi rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan and Indapur for military expenses. He was also given Fort
                Shivneri for his family's residence.</p>
            <p>At the time of Shivaji's birth, power in the Deccan was shared by three Islamic sultanates: Bijapur,
                Ahmednagar, and Golkonda. Shahaji often changed his loyalty between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the
                Adilshah of Bijapur and the Mughals, but always kept his jagir (fiefdom) at Pune and his small army.</p>
